Patch 8.0 support.

Communities chat support.

Improvements to handle severe latency.

More responsive chat handling.

Localization support (for the options menu). Please help translate this addon if you can. See the translations page on the CurseForge project!

Better Misspelled compatibility.

Tongues compatibility. This is MINIMAL support, and I doubt the majority of Tongues' features will even work with multi-message emotes. This should work for your simple dialects and "affects" though.

More API features.

And... code commentary! I got carried away. :)


## 1.3.4
libbw update.


## 1.3.3
Time and time again we tell ourselves to not type super long emotes in-game because the editbox is just so primitive, and it's so easy to lose things. It's just so darn convenient though. Worry not! Emote Splitter 1.3.3 adds undo functionality, so even if you screw up and close the chat editor mid-typing, or even if you disconnect, you can just press Ctrl-Z to undo and get your emote back!

Patch 7.3.5 update. I hope you're all having a wonderful Lunar Festival.

Added undo/redo.


## 1.3.2
Converts "\n" to newlines (breaks apart emotes).


## 1.3.1
Compatibility update.


## 1.3.0
Patch 7.3 compatibility.


## 1.2.9
Support for patch 7.2.5.

Splitting code is more stable.
