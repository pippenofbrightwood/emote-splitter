-- We have a basic chat throttler here. One might ask why we don't just use
--  ChatThrottleLib. We used to use libbw (a more bnet friendly CTL), but
--  there's a number of reasons it's our own implementation now.
-- (1) CTL doesn't support Bnet or community messages.
-- (2) CTL shares our bandwidth with addon data.
--     Our philosophy here is that chat text should have utmost priority, 
--      no matter how much data is being sent by addons. CTL splits data 
--      evenly between its different priorities. We want ALL of the bandwidth
--      while we're sending a chat message. Chat messages are not a regular
--      occurance so they can takeover the bandwidth.
-- (3) It's a pain in the ass to make it work right if you're hooking messages
--     from SendChatMessage, which COULD be from CTL, and then you have to deal
--     with the potential problem of feeding messages back into CTL after they
--     were already processed. We had a bit of a hacky solution for that before
--     which required hooks in CTL, but we don't do that anymore in preference
--     for this solution. This is more forward compatible.
-- The one little caveat to our little system, or Gopher's system in
--  general is when we intercept a chat message. When CTL sees addons sending
--  chat messages that haven't passed through its system, it subtracts from its
--  available bandwidth. This is a good thing, but the problem is when we
--  intercept a chat message /from/ CTL. In that case, we're breaking out of
--  their system, sending it on our own time... There's no easy way to detect
--  if we're pulling a message from CTL.
--
--  (0) CTL -> (1) _G.SendChatMessage -> Our Hook   (3) CTL's SCM Hook -> ...
--                                          |        ^
--                                          v        | 
--                                     (2) Gopher Queue --> (4) Wait --.
--                                              ^----------------------'
--
-- In (0) CTL subtracts from it's available bandwidth. It also does that in (3)
-- (3) has a check to see if it's executing from within CTL, but that check
--  fails if we reach (4) and break out of this execution path.
--
-- This could also look like this, if another addon loads before Gopher
--  that loads ChatThrottleLib:
--
-- (0) CTL -> (1) _G.SendChatMessage -> (2) CTL's hook -> (3) Our Hook
--                                                                  |
--                                                            .-----'
--                                                            v     
--                                       ... <-- (4) Our Queue (Might Wait)
--
-- This is a bit of a better execution path, except for we might be pushing
--  a little more over the chat limit, because CTL's hook is skipped when
--  the message is actually sent.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Some configuration here. BPS is how many bytes per second it will send
--  messages at. Each message's byte size is the length of the message text 
--  plus MSG_OVERHEAD. We don't actually know the limits on the server side, so
--  we don't waste much time being very exact with our calculations.
-- BURST is how much bandwidth we can store if there is a period of inactivity.
