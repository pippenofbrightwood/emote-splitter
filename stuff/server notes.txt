SendChatMessage reply may be either

  a throttle error (failure)
  a chat message event (success)
  both. the server may send a throttle error AND the chat message
  the throttle message may arrive before the chat messages
  
  if you send multiple chat messages at once, and there are throttle
   errors, then the errors arrive first, and then the chat messages after
   
  i assume that this can be split up due to some of your chat messages
   arriving later than others.
   
  but in essence, whatever batch of chat messages the server receives, it
   goes over them, processes them, and if they're "too much" it queues
   errors to send back first BEFORE any of the chat messages in the batch
   and then queues them after
   
  afaik there is one guarantee, that you will receive the chat message event
  OR the throttle error. with the throttle error, the message may be discarded
  
  with exceptional lag, you might encounter this problem:
  
    send a chat message
    receive the throttle error
    the short timeout expires before we try to resend the message
    we resend the message
    the message from the LAST output we receive now,
